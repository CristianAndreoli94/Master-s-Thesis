# Master-s-Thesis

This Master’s thesis tackles object detection in ultra‑high‑resolution SAR imagery from ICEYE, focusing on aircraft in complex airport scenes. A preprocessing pipeline for GRD and CSI products was implemented. A YOLOv8 CNN is adapted for detection and benchmarked against Vision Transformers and foundation models. Comparative experiments explore spatial resolutions (0.25–0.5 m), data formats, and model complexities, assessing recall, precision, and computational trade‑offs.
